									<p>Remember those enchanting Saturday nights, huddled with siblings, bewitched by the cinematic wonders of Harry, Hermione, and Ron? The Harry Potter movies were more than just films; they were the cornerstone of our childhood, weaving a tapestry of friendship, courage, and magic.  From the moment Hagrid uttered those unforgettable words, "You're a wizard, Harry," we were hooked. From the bustling corridors of Hogwarts to the enchanting forbidden forest, the movies were a visual feast. </p>

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h4>But how this fits in your puzzle?</h4>
									<p>Businesses crave stories behind their customers, and that's where I come in! Imagine this:
										<ul>
										<li>Want to know how customers *really* feel about your product? I can scrape reviews, analyze the emotions, and aha! You've got a magic potion of insights to improve it.</li>
										<li>Lost in a sea of social media comments? No worries! I can untangle the mess and reveal what people are *truly* saying.</li>
										<li>Stuck in a marketing rut? Fear not! I can decode the most powerful words that resonate with your audience, casting spells of attraction and boosting your brand.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>Let's continue this journey!</h2>
									<p></p>

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>My goal was to unravel the mysteries of Professor Snape from the Harry Potter series using web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques. Through this magical coding adventure, I aimed to understand Snape's emotional landscape and uncover the most enchanted words that defined his story.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapter 1: The Sorcery of Web Scraping</h3>
									<p>I employed the art of web scraping to gather Snape's story from a special webpage. Picture it like sending a coded owl to fetch a letter, but instead, we fetched paragraphs filled with Snape's tales. Using magical tools like BeautifulSoup and NLTK, I transformed these paragraphs into a neat scroll, saved in a CSV file.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Chapter 2: The Potion for Sentiment Analysis</h3>
									<p>This is where the real magic happens! I delved into Snape's sentiments using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer potion. By assigning magical labels like 'angry' or 'protective,' I unveiled the emotions that weave through Snape's narrative. The results painted a captivating picture-Snape's worries took the lead, followed by contempt, anger, and a strong sense of protectiveness.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapter 3: Discovering the Most Magical Words</h3>
									<p>Summoning the top words echoing in digital Hogwarts, I created a playlist of wizarding hits: Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Lily. It's like decoding Snape's favorite spells. Filtering mundane words and lemmatizing for simplicity, I uncovered the essence of Snape's story.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Key Insights: </h3>
									<h4>Snape's Emotional Landscape</h4>
                                    <p>The sentiment analysis potion unveiled the layers of Snape's emotions. From the depths of worry to the heights of
                                     protectiveness, Snape's sentiments paint a portrait of a character as complex as the enchanted dungeons of
                                     Hogwarts.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                     <li>Worry takes the lead with 22.51%, reflecting Snape's perpetual concern in the wizarding saga.</li>
                                     <li>Contempt and anger follow closely at 19.32% and 14.94%, capturing Snape's moments of disdain and frustration.
                                     </li>
                                     <li>Protectiveness stands tall at 10.06%, showcasing the guardian within Snape.</li>
                                      <li>Sarcasm, sacrifice, ambiguity, and affection weave through his narrative, each adding a unique hue to the canvas
                                        of his emotions.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Snape's Incantations - Top 5 Magical Words</h4>

                                    <ul>
									  <li>The word 'Snape' appears 703 times. As expected, the enigmatic Potions Master is at the center of his own tale.</li>
                                      <li>Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort make appearances, emphasizing the interconnectedness of Snape's story with the
                                       broader wizarding world.</li>
                                       <li>The name 'Lily' blooms, reminding us of the poignant ties woven into Snape's complex narrative.</li>
                                      </ul>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion: </h3>
									<p>In this magical coding journey, Snape's layers unfolded like a digital scroll. The code spilled the tea on Snape's feelings and the words that made him the wizard we love (and maybe secretly roll our eyes at). It's like unlocking the secrets of the Half-Blood Prince himself!</p>
